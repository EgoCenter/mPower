<p>The data collected through the app will be encrypted on the phone. <br /><br /> 
We will separate your account information (name, email, contact information, etc.) from the study data (the responses to phone surveys and the measurements from the phone itself when performing activities). <br /><br /> 
We will use a random code instead of your name on all study data. This code cannot be used to directly re-identify you.  Information about the code will be kept in a separate secure system.  Only key personnel from the study team may get the key to associate your study data to your name and account information if needed. <br /><br />
We will NOT access your personal contacts, other applications, personal photos, texts, emails, or websites visited.</p>
