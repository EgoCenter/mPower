<p>Your coded data will be aggregated for analysis onto Sage Bionetworks' Synapse data analysis platform in the United States.<br /><br />

By analyzing the data from all app users, we hope to better understand the symptoms and their triggers, learn the variations in Parkinson disease, assess whether mobile devices and sensors can help better measure and manage these symptoms, and ultimately improve the quality of life for people with PD.</p>
